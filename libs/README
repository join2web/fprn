Original code by Andrej Pakhutin (pakhutin@gmail.com), 2013

This code was once just a part of fprn project, but later transformed into self-contained library now called AP's Toolkit
Note, that fprn was not yet transformed to use the new library, so this code remains here.

For the AP's Toolkit library go to:
* Main repository at the github: git clone https://github.com/kadavris/aps-toolkit.git
* Secondary at sourceforge: git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/apstoolkit/code apstoolkit-code
* Compiled libraries at sourceforge: http://sourceforge.net/projects/apstoolkit/files/?source=navbar
